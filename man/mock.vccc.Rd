\description{
A simulated dataset constructed to imitate the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care
Clinic (VCCC) patient records, which have been fully validated and therefore
contain validated and unvalidated versions of all variables. The VCCC
cohort is a good candidate for the purpose of illustration. The
data presented in this section are a mocked-up version of the actual data
due to confidentiality, but the data structure and features, such as mean
and variability, closely resemble the real dataset.
